# noir-pjax-example

I don't like doing a lot of client side Javascript (or Coffeescript) development. pjax is a way to minimize client side Javascript while maintaining fast page load times.

I became interested in pjax after reading an article on the development of Basecamp Next. DHH indicated that they looked at pjax but then rolled their own similar system.

Some pjax references:

## Usage

lein run
```
